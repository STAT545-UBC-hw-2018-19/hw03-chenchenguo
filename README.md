The problem about the wrong display of some tables in markdown file is figured out. However, I figured it later utill now.
The reason behind that is due to github will occur problem when adding comments inside R chunk. If adding comments outside the R chunk, there will be no problem. 
Hope this statement can make up the table problem.
